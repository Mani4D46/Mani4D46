I don't use Github anymore and encourage you to do the same (look [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.html) for providers to avoid). github itself is NOT opensource and WILL use your code to train Large Language Models [<sup>[1]</sup>](https://sanctum.geek.nz/why-not-github.html).
